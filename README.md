# Malaysia-ATM-Simulator
This project is to simulate the ATM machine in Python . The currency will be in MYR (Malaysian ringgit) . This project was made to serve as a step up in my programming skill with the usage of "global" variable and serve as an application for my past 4 projects.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key Features of the Code:

1. Secure Authentication: 
- A PIN-based login system that tracks attempts. If the user enters the wrong PIN 3 times, the account is locked and the program exits.

2. Account Management:
- The simulator includes a "Change PIN" feature that requires the original PIN for verification and double-checks the new PIN before saving.

3. Simulator Tools:
- A unique "Factory Reset" option specifically for this simulator that restores the default balance and PIN instantly.

4. Graceful Error Handling:
- Instead of letting the program crash with scary code errors , I used try-except blocks to catch mistakes and provide helpful, human-readable instructions on how to fix them.

5. Currency denomination adjustments:
- I used specific text formatting (like RM{balance:.2f}) to ensure currency always looks professional and realistic, mirroring a real Malaysian ATM screen.

6. Smart Validation:
- I implemented mathematical checks such as (round(oa * 100) % 5 == 0) to ensure users only interact with valid Malaysian currency denominations, preventing unrealistic transactions.

7. Efficient Input Selection:
- Instead of using long chains of if/else statements for withdrawals selection menu , I implemented Python Dictionaries to map menu numbers directly to RM values.

To use this simulator:

Default PIN number : 123456
Default balance : RM1000.00
(the balance and pin number is able to change throughout the session)

To run the simulator:
- chmod +x atm\ simulator.py
- ./atm\ simulator.py
