# Simple Malaysia ATM Simulator
A command-line ATM simulator built in Python that mimics real Malaysian banking interactions such as withdrawals, deposits, and PIN authentication.

This project was created to strengthen my understanding of Python concepts including input validation, error handling, global variables, and clean program structure.

Key features of the code:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Secure Authentication: 
- A PIN-based login system that tracks login attempts. If the user enters the wrong PIN 3 times, the account is locked and the program exits.
 

2. Account Management:
- The simulator includes a "Change PIN" feature that requires the original PIN for verification and verifies the new PIN before saving.


3. Simulator Tools:
- A unique "Factory Reset" option  that restores the default balance and PIN instantly.


4. Graceful Error Handling:
- Instead of letting the program crash with errors , I used try-except blocks to catch mistakes and provide helpful, human-readable instructions on how to fix them.


5. Currency denomination adjustments:
- I used formatted outputs like (RM{balance:.2f}) to ensure currency always looks professional and realistic, mirroring a real Malaysian ATM screen.


6. Smart Validation:
- I implemented mathematical checks such as (round(oa * 100) % 5 == 0) to ensure users only interact with valid Malaysian currency denominations, preventing unrealistic transactions.


7. Efficient Input Selection:
- Instead of using long chains of if/else statements for the withdrawal selection menu , I implemented Python Dictionaries to map menu numbers directly to RM values.

To use this simulator:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Default PIN number : 123456
- Default balance : RM1000.00
- Account number : 1234567890 

(The balance and PIN can be changed throughout the session.)
(All bank information are strictly fictional and it is not relevant with real life)

To run the simulator:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- chmod +x atm_simulator.py
- ./atm_simulator.py

What I learnt throughout the project:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Handling user input and edge cases

- Structuring Python applications logically

- Implementing basic security features

- Using dictionaries for cleaner code design
